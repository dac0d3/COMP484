        <h2>Who is the Best Soccer Player of All Time?</h2>
        <p>Many consider Pel√© to be the greatest soccer player of all time. With three World Cup victories, an incredible goal-scoring record, and a lasting impact on the sport, he remains an icon.</p>
        <p>Others argue that Diego Maradona, with his astonishing dribbling skills and leadership, is the best ever, especially after his legendary performance in the 1986 World Cup.</p>
        <p>Modern fans might say Lionel Messi is the greatest, given his unmatched consistency, dribbling, vision, and record-breaking achievements, including multiple Ballon d'Or titles.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Cristiano Ronaldo has left his mark with his incredible goal-scoring ability, athleticism, and success across multiple leagues.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the debate is subjective, but these players have undoubtedly shaped the history of soccer.</p>
