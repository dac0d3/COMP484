            <dt><h2>Garlic Butter Chicken with Creamy Spinach (Ketogenic)</h2></dt>
            <dd><h3> Ingredients:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp olive oil<br></li>
                    <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
                    <li>2 cups fresh spinach</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)</li>

                </ul><br>
            <p> Cooking Instructions:<br><br>
                Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the 
                chicken breasts with salt and pepper, then sear them for about 4-5 minutes 
                on each side until golden brown and fully cooked. Remove the chicken from the 
                skillet and set it aside. In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium and 
                add butter. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for about a minute until 
                fragrant. Pour in the heavy cream and Parmesan cheese, stirring continuously
                until the sauce begins to thicken. Add the Italian seasoning and red pepper
                flakes if using, then stir in the fresh spinach and cook until wilted. 
                Return the chicken to the skillet, coating it with the creamy garlic butter
                sauce, and let it simmer for another 2-3 minutes. Serve hot and enjoy!
