            <dt><h2>Strength Training</h2></dt>
            <dd><h3>Strength training helps build and maintain muscle, 
                which is essential for overall strength, bone health, 
                and metabolism. Lifting weights or using resistance exercises 
                improves posture, enhances joint stability, and reduces the risk 
                of injury. It also increases muscle mass, which can help with fat
                 loss by boosting the bodyâ€™s calorie-burning ability even at rest.
            </h3><br></dd>
            
            <dt><h2>Cardio</h2></dt>
            <dd><h3>Cardio workouts improve heart health, lung capacity, 
                and overall endurance. Activities like running, cycling, 
                and swimming help lower blood pressure, improve circulation, 
                and reduce the risk of heart disease. Additionally, cardio is 
                a great way to burn calories, manage weight, and boost mood 
                through the release of endorphins.
            </h3><br></dd>
            
            <dt><h2>HIIT (High Interval Training)</h2></dt>
            <dd><h3>HIIT is a time-efficient workout that combines 
                short bursts of intense exercise with rest periods, 
                maximizing calorie burn and metabolic rate. It improves 
                cardiovascular fitness while also building muscle endurance.
                 HIIT is particularly effective for fat loss, as it keeps the
                  body burning calories even after the workout ends (known as 
                  the afterburn effect).
            </h3><br></dd>
            
            <dt><h2>Flexibility & Mobility Training </h2></dt>
            <dd><h3>Flexibility and mobility training improve range of motion,
                balance, and muscle recovery. Practices like yoga and Pilates 
                help reduce muscle stiffness, prevent injuries, and enhance 
                posture. These workouts also promote relaxation and stress 
                relief, making them beneficial for both physical and mental 
                well-being.
