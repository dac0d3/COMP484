            <dt><h2>Mediterranean Diet</h2></dt>
            <dd><h3>The Mediterranean diet focuses on whole foods 
                like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, fish,
                 and olive oil, while limiting processed foods and 
                 red meat. It’s great for heart health, reducing 
                 inflammation, and lowering the risk of chronic 
                 diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure.
                  This diet is also rich in healthy fats and 
                  antioxidants, making it a great option for 
                  overall well-being.

            <dt><h2>Ketogenic</h2></dt>
            <dd><h3>The keto diet is a high-fat, 
                low-carb diet that encourages the body to
                 enter a state of ketosis, where it burns fat 
                 for energy instead of carbohydrates. This diet
                  is beneficial for weight loss, blood sugar control, 
                  and improving insulin sensitivity. It may also provide
                   mental clarity and steady energy levels, though it 
                   requires strict carb restriction.
            </h3><br></dd>
            

            <dt><h2>Vegan Diet</h2></dt>
            <dd><h3>A vegan diet eliminates all animal products, including meat,
                dairy, and eggs, focusing on plant-based foods.
                 It’s excellent for heart health, reducing cholesterol
                  levels, and promoting environmental sustainability. 
                  A well-balanced vegan diet can provide plenty of 
                  nutrients while reducing the risk of certain diseases,
                   but it requires careful planning to ensure enough 
                   protein, B12, and iron intake.
           </h3><br></dd>
            

            <dt><h2>Paleo Diet </h2></dt>
            <dd><h3>The paleo diet emphasizes eating foods that early 
                humans consumed, such as lean meats, fish, fruits, 
                vegetables, nuts, and seeds, while avoiding processed 
                foods, dairy, and grains. It’s great for reducing 
                inflammation, improving digestion, and stabilizing 
                blood sugar levels. This diet encourages whole, 
                unprocessed foods, which can lead to better energy 
                levels and weight management.
